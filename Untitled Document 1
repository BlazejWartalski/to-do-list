PLAN:

1. Page elements
2. Basic CSSrsonally my to-do-list has to be the top 10 worst coded things on this planet but definitely try that. Also that difficulty feeling is normal, it really does feel like a unsurmountabl
3. Function to create new tasks
4. Function to store tasks in local memory
5. Create,Read,Update,Delete
6. Enhanced CSS


What to do :
Logic: 		Function to create new task + project, to edit, to remove, to add status, to change date etc, Night Mode/Day Mode

Display: 	add settings to sort and view tasks by date, and my project name.
			Option to add, change status, edit, remove tasks.

Navigation to the left:		Alternate between expanding project and hiding project on click.

Top bar, bottom bar - easy shit dont even worry about it not much work to be done there

store it all locally
display all of it and generate new dom element for each of these elements.
